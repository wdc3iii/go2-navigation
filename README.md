# go2-navigation
Repository aimed at running SLAM-based navigation on the Go2

```export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=5```
```export OBELISK_BUILD_UNITREE=true```

## Useful commands
Setup:
```
bash setup.sh
```

Enter the docker container: 
```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --build sample-walking
```

Build and activate Obelisk:
```
obk
```

Build all the packages:
```
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers $(nproc)
```

Build packages with verbose output:
```
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers $(nproc) --event-handlers console_direct+
```

Build packages in debug mode:
```
colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers $(nproc) --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Source the package:
```
source install/setup.bash
```

Set logging dir:
```
export ROS_HOME=~/sample-contact-walking
```
## Launch the Achilles stack:
```
obk-launch config_file_path=${SAMPLE_WALKING_ROOT}/sample_contact_walking/configs/achilles_sim_config.yaml device_name=onboard auto_start=configure bag=false
```

Wait for the viz software to connect then run in a seperate terminal:
```
obk-activate achilles_sim
```

## Launch the Go2 stack:
```
obk-launch config_file_path=${SAMPLE_WALKING_ROOT}/sample_contact_walking/configs/go2_sim_config.yaml device_name=onboard auto_start=configure bag=false
```

Wait for the viz software to connect then run in a seperate terminal:
```
obk-activate go2_sim
```

## Launch the G1 stack:
```
obk-launch config_file_path=${SAMPLE_WALKING_ROOT}/sample_contact_walking/configs/g1_sim_config.yaml device_name=onboard auto_start=configure bag=false
```

Wait for the viz software to connect then run in a seperate terminal:
```
obk-activate g1_sim
```

If you have issues with others on the ROS network then set `ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY`.

## Connecting the joystick
### USB
Can verify that the the controller connects via
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install evtest
sudo evtest /dev/input/eventX
```
where you replace eventX with the correct number. You can see these by looking at `/dev/input/`.

Then you may need to change the permissions for the joystick:
```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/input/eventX
```
event24 seems to be consistent for the xbox remote for my machine.

Can run `ros2 run joy joy_enumerate_devices` to see what devices are found.


## Random notes
- As of 10/14/2024 I need to work on the obelisk joystick branch, and until the docker container is re-build with these updates I will need to re-install `ros-humble-joy` from apt-get:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-joy
```
- As of 11/11/2024 I need to be om the obelisk branch with simulation geom viz
